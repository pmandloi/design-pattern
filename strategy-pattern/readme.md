# Strategy Pattern

### Definition
<br />

> â€œStrategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, It encapsulated each one and make them interchangable. strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that uses.

<br />

#### When to use

> You should consider using the Strategy Pattern when you have a situation where there are multiple algorithms or behaviors that a class can use, and you want to be able to switch between them dynamically at runtime. This can help you avoid code duplication and make your code more modular and flexible.

#### Important point

> Composition + DI over Inheritance
